## Getting Started

 You need an instance of the _Saleor_ backend up and running in order to successfully run this project. The easiest way is probably to use [Saleor Cloud](https://cloud.saleor.io/) and its free tier.

Follow these steps in order to execute the project correctly:

1. Rename the `.env.local.example` into `.env.local` and fill the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL` environment variable with the correct URL to your GraphQL API;

2. Start the project in development mode using `pnpm dev`;
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser;
4. 🎉

## Configuration

You can configure your storefront using the environment variables in `src/misc/config.ts`. The only required configuration is `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`, everything else is optional and has been documented directly in the file.
