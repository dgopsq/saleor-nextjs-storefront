## Getting Started

**Requirements:**

- An instance of the _Saleor_ backend up and running (the easiest way is probably to use [Saleor Cloud](https://cloud.saleor.io/) and its free tier)
- The [Saleor Stripe App](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/app-store/apps/stripe) installed in the dashboard

**Follow these steps in order to execute the project correctly:**

1. Rename the `.env.local.example` into `.env.local` and fill the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL` environment variable with the correct URL to your GraphQL API
2. Generate the GraphQL types using `pnpm generate:graphql`
3. Start the project in development mode using `pnpm dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser
5. 🎉

## Configuration

You can configure your storefront using the environment variables in [`src/misc/config.ts`](https://github.com/dgopsq/saleor-nextjs-base/blob/main/src/misc/config.ts). The only required configuration is `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`, everything else is optional and has been documented directly in the file.
